          If you have any concerns or issues about your safety department being DOT compliant,
          you owe it to yourself to contact JP Transportation Safety Consulting. It has been a
          pleasure working with a consulting firm that actually knows and understands the
          trucking industry. With JPTSCâ€™s knowledgeable staff and dedication to the success of
          the ATA and motor carriers cross the nation, I would highly recommend their consulting
          services.
