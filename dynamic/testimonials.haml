      JPTSC provides consistent, sensible, and easy to follow solutions to complex issues
      involving federal, state and local regulations. I have received many unsolicited laudatory
      comments from our transportation managers attending the training sessions of JPTSC that
      this was the first time they were able to clearly understand ‘”how” the whole process fits
      together.
    %p
      The consulting services of JPTSC are a superb combination of common-sense, technical
      expertise, and approachability that far outweighs its competition.

      A sincere thanks goes to the professional assistance we have received from JPTSC since 2004.
      Your staff has been very helpful through the years and we credit our DOT satisfaction rating
      to your intervention and helpfulness during the compliance review process. It was nice to
      know that you were on-site assisting us during the entire review.
    %p
      Any time I’ve had a question, you have always been available to provide an answer. Needless
      to say the trucking knowledge and experience of JPTSC continues to be an invaluable asset to
      our organization. Again, thanks for all your help.

      JP Transportation Safety Consulting has played a major role in helping my company keep our
      fleet safe and compliant with all applicable regulations. They continue to provide us training
      and certification where needed and have conducted mock DOT audits and assessments to keep us
      prepared and ready for an official review.
    %p
      JPTSC is ethical, trustworthy, and always just a phone call away when help is needed. My
      relationship with JPTSC has been ongoing for over a decade and I have not only employed their
      services personally, but continue to refer many clients to them because of their industry
      experience and eagerness to serve their clients.
    %p
      I would recommend the consulting services of JPTSC to any trucking company seeking expert
      advice on DOT regulations and best safety practices.

      I have been doing business with JP Transportation Safety Consulting for many years and the
      level of commitment and service I’ve received has always been exceptional. The quality of
      information provided by their unique and long-term relationship with the Alabama Trucking
      Association has been tremendous having served with them on boards, councils, and multiple
      committees.
    %p
      It has been a pleasure working with a consulting firm that actually knows and understands
      the trucking industry. With JPTSC’s knowledgeable staff and dedication to the success of the
      ATA and motor carriers cross the nation, I would highly recommend their consulting services.
      If you have any concerns or issues about your safety department being DOT compliant, you owe
      it to yourself to contact JP Transportation Safety Consulting.
